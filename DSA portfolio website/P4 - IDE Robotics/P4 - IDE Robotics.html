        <p> There were boxes on the map and each had a different color.
            (Red, blue, green, and yellow)
           Our robot has two large motors for the wheels, and 
           a mechanism that could lift an object with added friction,
           that prevented the lego humans from falling down.
           We had to get each Lego human color to the boxes with their color on them. 
           There was also a surprise rule on the day of the competition: 
           we had a yellow human stacked on our robot at the start of the run.
           The robot held the Lego humans nicely and the friction we added worked. 
           The speed of our robot was just nice and the
           run was completed early and we got high marks.
           We used propotional line tracing to navigate through the staight and turning lines.
           Our robot had lines of code for line tracing, that could be 
           placed together to complete the missions. 
           The robot would need only a fair bit of adjustment to execute the missions.
           This competition gave me a nice idea of what other competitions are like
           and gave me a nice boost in my robotics skills.</p>
