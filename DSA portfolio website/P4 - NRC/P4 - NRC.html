        <p>During this competition, there were four Lego humans placed on the map. 
            However, there were no pre-set locations. 
           This competition helped me think more clearly about
            how one simple mechanism can solve multiple problems,
            for example, during the competition, We had a simple 
            the arm that opened and closed to chop down and collect 
            the weeds. There were two kinds of weeds, green and red,
            good and bad respectively. We limited the options for the 
            robot so that it could scan each weed with a color 
            sensor or like what we did, run through all the weeds 
            while knocking down the bad weeds and collecting the good weeds.
            Our robot used double-line tracing and proportional 
            line tracing to trace the lines.
            Our robot will turn towards the line when it has turned to the
            wrong sensor for line tracing. Our robot was compact and was 
            able to turn without knocking anything over.
            This competition helped me strategize my building 
            more to ensure that the robot is more compact and does 
            not exceed the limitations of space.</p>
