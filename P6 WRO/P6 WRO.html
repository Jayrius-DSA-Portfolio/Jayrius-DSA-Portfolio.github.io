            During WRO 2024, the field featured 8 vegetable props—4 yellow 
            and 4 red—along with 3 green plants, 3 pieces of earth, 3 water cubes, 
            fences, greenhouses, a chicken, and a water tower. Throughout the runs, 
            our robot had to navigate the field carefully, avoiding the chicken and 
            fences, collect all 8 vegetable props, retrieve water from the tower, 
            deliver it to the green plants, and push the earth blocks away. 
            This competition proved to be one of the toughest I’ve ever participated in, 
            as it required all the skills I had learned in robotics, from color 
            scanning to using lines for robot alignment. Additionally, with the 
            competition falling close to my examination period, preparation time was 
            extremely limited. Despite these challenges, our team’s perseverance and 
            determination paid off, and we were able to secure second place.
