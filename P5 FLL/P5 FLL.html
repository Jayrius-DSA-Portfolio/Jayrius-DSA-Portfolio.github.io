        like the Hybrid Car and the television.
        We had to complete as many missions as possible in two minutes and thirty seconds. 
        We planned the whole run to be split into 4 runs. 
        Run 2 was the smallest and run 4 had the most to execute. 
        Our robot had many extensions that could sometimes do more than 1 mission.
        Our robot used color sensors to catch some of the 
        isolated lines and used proportional, 
        double, and single-line tracing to navigate through the field.
        During the runs, I and my team managed to change the extensions quickly to ensure
        that the least amount of time was used to ensure that the robot had more time
        to carry out the run. Due to the time constraint, our robot only managed to do runs 1 and 2.
        We had to use one precision token that allowed us to transfer our robot to the 
        other side of the field and skip run 3. This competition taught me how to 
        systematically plan my missions and how time was precious in a run. </p>
